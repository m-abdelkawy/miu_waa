2.a) Status of the lab: complete

for both labs
I have separated the code in different layers as requested
Web Layer: Controllers and DTOs
Data Access: Repositories
Service Layer: BookService and BankService
Business Layer (domain classes)

also I have added validation on the domain classes using javax annotations 
and added an extra test method for each lab to test 400 badrequest code and error message
upon invalid input.



I hereby declare that this submission is my own original work and to the best of my
knowledge it contains no materials previously published or written by another person.
I am aware that submitting solutions that are not my own work will result in an NC of
the course.
I am aware that I am not allowed to share solutions with other students.
I am aware that if I submit only parts of this lab that points will be subtracted.
I am aware that if my lab submission does not contain this readme.txt file that I do not
get points for this lab.
