--Lab1ServletCalculator
- All parts are finished yet I got some ideas from your solution on code organizxation and the session usage
- My original solution is commented and it was working yet only gives null pointer exception on the 1st get request (as there are no params)
- I originally used a property in the servlet class List<List<String>> to add the operations to
- I have checked your video solution after that and switched to use session (trying to go fast as possible to catch and start on the second lesson)




--Lab1SpringMVC
-All parts are finished and all is done by me
-I have created a new controller with the name "CalcController"
-Added a method "calc" that returns the view with the params (num1, num2, operator, result) as requested
