Lab status: Complete

part 1 is simple and implemented as requested

part 2
for the tests, comment the exclusion of tomcat in the pom file and remove the rest client

I got circular referencing error for the rest client (I do not fully understand why)
for the injection of the restTemplate
but I found solution online to enable circular referencing in the properties file

I changed to the DTO implementation as requested and the tests work fine
