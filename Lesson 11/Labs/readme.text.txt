Status of the lab: Complete

Part 1 and Part 2 are my own and pretty similar to demos. part 3 was quite challenging and it's 4 AM now
so I benefited from your solution for structuring the code and for study purpose



I hereby declare that this submission is my own original work and to the best of my
knowledge it contains no materials previously published or written by another person.
I am aware that submitting solutions that are not my own work will result in an NC of
the course.
I am aware that I am not allowed to share solutions with other students.
I am aware that if I submit only parts of this lab that points will be subtracted.
I am aware that if my lab submission does not contain this readme.txt file that I do not
get points for this lab.
